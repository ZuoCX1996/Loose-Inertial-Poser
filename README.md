# Loose Inertial Poser: Motion Capture with IMU-attached Loose-Wear Jacket
![](https://github.com/ZuoCX1996/Loose-Inertial-Poser/blob/main/figs/teaser.png)

Implementation of our CVPR 2024 paper "Loose Inertial Poser: Motion Capture with IMU-attached Loose-Wear Jacket". Including network weights, training and evaluation scripts.

Run [train_SemoAE.py](./train_SemoAE.py) to train SeMo-AE.

Run [train_poser.py](./train_poser.py) to train pose estimation network.

Run [evaluation.py](./evaluation.py) to get ang Err and pos Err.

## Live Demo 
1. Prepare the pose visualization unity project. You can find it at TransPose project page: https://github.com/Xinyu-Yi/TransPose
2. Run [live demo.py](./live%20demo.py)
3. Run unity visualization

## LIP Dataset
The real-world dataset is in the folder named **LIP_Dataset**, please notice that the original data frame rate is **60Hz**, and it was downsampled to 30Hz in our implementation.

The original data frame rate is 60Hz, and it was down sampled to 30Hz which is a 50% reduction.
